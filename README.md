 Please see the links for the .xlsm file and the vba script files.


 VBA script is created to loop through all the stocks for one year, for each worksheet in the Workbook.

 Following information are displayed in 4 columns, for each worksheet.

1) Stock's ticker symbol 
2) Yearly change over a year for each stock 
3) Percent change for the stock over a year 
4) Total stock volume of the stock.

 Color formatting is done for the Yearly change column, highlighting the positive change in green and negative change in red.


Script is created to display the  "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
